Hi, I'm Shea! Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a staff software engineer at [[https://www.anduril.com][Anduril]], improving the core software platform that powers our products and development processes.

I write longer-form sporadically on my [[{{< relref "/blog" >}}][blog]], and much shorter and less sporadically on [[https://twitter.com/shlevy][twitter]]. My username is ~shlevy~ on most sites.

I live with my wife and three sons in Durham, NH.
